L2TP: east has two template connections; each on a different interface

East is configured with two template connections:

    conn l2tp-north-to-east-east
	right=192.1.2.23
    conn l2tp-distraction-on-east
	right=192.1.3.33.

where both have:

        ikev2=no
        type=transport
	leftsubnet=vhost:%priv,%no
        left=%any
        leftprotoport=17/%any

(since it is transport mode leftclient= should track left[host]=
during instantiation?).

North tries to use quick mode to establish L2TP for:

      192.1.2.23/32:1701 -UDP-> 192.1.3.33/32:1701

In v4.5 it worked.

In v4.6 the overlap-ip check gets confused because it sees:

     192.1.3.33:UDP/1701 is within distraction's left[client]=%any
