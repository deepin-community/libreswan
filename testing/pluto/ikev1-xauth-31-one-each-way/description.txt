IKEv1 road establishes tunnel to east; east then quick-modes a tunnel back

Trying to reproduce github #633.

road, using xauth, establishes a tunnel to east
east, then establishes a second tunnel (using the same parent) back to road

Suspect the problem is that the east->road connection is rejected on
road as it gets confused with the proposed subnet vs road's 0.0.0.0/0.
