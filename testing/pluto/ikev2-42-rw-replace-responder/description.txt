IKEv2 RW test with rekey=no on initiator and rekey=yes on responder

Responder's ikelifetime is 60s (margin 10s) so it will try to re-key
the IKE SA around then.

1. Road (initiator) initiates and establish connection.
2. Road (initiator) keeps the tunnel up.
3. East (responder) initiates rekey and tunnel stays up.
