ESN test esn=yes replay-window=0. The IKE negotiation should fail.

RFC 4303: #section-3.3.3
   Note: If a receiver chooses to not enable anti-replay for an SA, then
   the receiver SHOULD NOT negotiate ESN in an SA management protocol.
   Use of ESN creates a need for the receiver to manage the anti-replay
   window (in order to determine the correct value for the high-order
   bits of the ESN, which are employed in the ICV computation), which is
   generally contrary to the notion of disabling anti-replay for an SA.

This test has replay_window=0 on the east, on the IKE initiator. If we set
replay-window=0. on the IKE initiator it will be testing the xfrm stack!
since east has non zero replay window east will succeed and west will fail.

May be west should not initiate an IKE negotiation with ESN_YES?
Or even better do not load a connection with esn=yes and replay-window=0
