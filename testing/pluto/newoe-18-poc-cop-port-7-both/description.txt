An OE connection only covering tcp port 7 to east. This one is
configured for both incoming and outgoing port 7. This tests if the
priorities of protoport OE connections get the right values.

(we use 7 so we can echo something and get closed connection)

See newoe-18-poc-cop-port-7-both-reorder where the order of
clear-or-private entries is reversed, and east has to switch
connections in IKE_AUTH
